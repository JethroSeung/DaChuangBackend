## 🎯 Next Steps Priority

### High Priority (Week 1-2)
1. Complete UAV management CRUD operations
2. Implement map view with real-time tracking
3. Add form validation and error handling
4. Create hibernate pod management interface

### Medium Priority (Week 3-4)
1. Implement remaining pages (battery, flight logs, etc.)
2. Add comprehensive testing suite
3. Optimize performance and bundle size
4. Implement authentication and security

### Low Priority (Week 5-6)
1. Advanced features and analytics
2. Mobile app considerations
3. Documentation improvements
4. Deployment optimization

## 🔧 Technical Debt

### Known Issues
