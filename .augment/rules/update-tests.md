Analyze the backend modules in this codebase and add comprehensive test coverage. Please:

1. First, examine the existing backend code structure to understand the current modules, their functionality, and any existing tests
2. Identify areas with insufficient or missing test coverage, including:
   - Unit tests for individual functions and methods
   - Integration tests for module interactions
   - Edge cases and error handling scenarios
   - API endpoint testing (if applicable)
   - Database operations testing (if applicable)
3. Create additional test files following the project's existing testing conventions and framework
4. Ensure tests cover:
   - Happy path scenarios
   - Error conditions and exception handling
   - Boundary conditions and edge cases
   - Input validation
   - Business logic correctness
5. Aim for comprehensive coverage while maintaining test quality and maintainability
6. After adding tests, run the test suite to verify all tests pass and provide a summary of the coverage improvements

Please focus on practical, meaningful tests that will help catch regressions and ensure code reliability rather than just achieving high coverage percentages.
